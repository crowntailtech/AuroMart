📦 Core Idea
AuroMart is a B2B web platform (and future mobile app) where retailers can place product orders from nearby distributors or manufacturers. It uses WhatsApp to enable instant communication, order alerts, and invoice sharing.

End-to-End Flow (With All 3 Roles)

Step 1: Manufacturer adds products and connects with Distributors.
Step 2: Distributor adds available stock and sets delivery options.
Step 3: Retailer signs in, browses products, and places an order.
Step 4: Distributor gets an instant WhatsApp alert: “New Order from XYZ Retailer.”
Step 5: Distributor reviews, acknowledges, and selects:
  ✅ I will deliver
  ✅ Retailer will pick up
Step 6: System generates a PDF invoice.
Step 7: Retailer receives the invoice via WhatsApp and can download from the dashboard.
Step 8: Admin or system tracks:
  - Order status
  - Monthly reports
  - Total order count by retailer
  - Category-wise performance

Step 9: Manufacturer can view sales reports from distributors (without accessing specific retailer details unless allowed).
